          <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

          <p>At this point the core developers would like to mention and credit some of the many people who
            have been helping us in different ways during the course of this project. Without their help
            and encouragement NEFI would not have happened.</p>

          <h4>Prof. Dr. Tetsuo Ueda</h4>

          <p>We are very grateful towards Prof. Ueda for introducing us to the interesting world of slime
            molds, for generously sharing his experiences and insights and for providing us with our very
            first samples of P. polycephalum. We sincerely hope that our software will be of use to the
            people in the field which he helped to pioneer.</p>

          <h4>Prof. Dr. Markus Hauser and Dr. Werner Baumgarten</h4>

          <p>We'd like to thank <a href=
                                   "http://www.biophysik.ovgu.de/Mitarbeiter/Mitarbeiterseiten/Marcus+Hauser-p-126.html">Prof.
              Hauser</a> for cordially inviting us to visit him and his group in Magdeburg to talk about all
            things Physarum.</p>

          <p>We thank <a href="http://www.strukturbildung.ovgu.de/Mitarbeiter/Werner+Baumgarten.html"
                         rel="nofollow">Dr. Baumgarten</a> for supplying us with a high quality image of P. polycephalum
            taken in the course of his experimental work. His picture helped drive the development of NEFI
            in the early stages where we were just getting our own lab-work started.</p>

          <h4>Prof. Dr. Andreas Manz and Mag. Tim Mehlhorn</h4>

          <p>We are happy to thank <a href=
                                      "http://www.frias.uni-freiburg.de/de/das-institut/archiv-frias/school-of-softmatter/fellows/manz">
              Prof. A. Manz</a> at the <a href="http://www.kist-europe.de/index.php/en/">KIST Europe</a> for
            providing us with the lab space and the equipment necessary to conduct our own experiments with
            P. Polycephalum. Without the material that originated at the KIST this software would not have
            been possible.</p>

          <p>We are glad to work together with Mag. Mehlhorn who contributed crucially to this project by
            culturing P. Polycephalum and taking high quality images.</p>

          <h4>Prof. Dr. Joachim Weickert</h4>

          <p>We'd like to thank <a href="http://www.mia.uni-saarland.de/weickert/index.shtml">Prof. Weickert</a> for valuable comments and suggestions on the topic of computer vision and image processing.</p>

          <h4>Students of Saarland University</h4>

          <p>At this point we also like to credit the students of the software engineering lecture of the
            winter term of 2013. Their work is at the core of NEFI 1.0 and NEFI 2.0. Our thanks go to:</p>

          <u>Winter term 2013:</u>

          <ul>

            <li>Adrian Mang</li>
            <li>Valentin Savenko</li>
          </ul>

          <u>Winter term 2015:</u>

          <ul>  
            <li>Dennis Groß</li>
            <li>Phillipp Reichert</li>

          </ul>

          <h4>Prof. Dr. Kurt Mehlhorn</h4>

          <p>We are very grateful to be the students of Prof. Mehlhorn. Without his guidance, patience,
            support as well as the freedom he gives us in realizing our projects, none of this would have
            been possible.</p>
